| [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) | #33 | Search for a target value in a rotated sorted array using a modified binary search approach. |

---

## 💡 Concepts Practiced
- Applied **modified binary search** on a **rotated sorted array**  
- Identified the **sorted half** (left or right) in each iteration  
- Compared **target position** relative to mid and boundary indices  
- Handled **rotation edge cases** efficiently  
- Achieved **O(log n)** time complexity with constant space  
- Strengthened logical reasoning in **partition-based searching**
